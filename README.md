# The official repository for the Rock the JVM Scala & Functional Programming practice course

This repository contains the code we wrote during  [Rock the JVM's Scala & Functional Programming Practice](https://rockthejvm.com/course/scala-functional-programming-practice) course. Unless explicitly mentioned, the code in this repository is exactly what was caught on camera.

## How to install

```
git checkout master
```

### How to run an intermediate state

The repository was built while recording the lectures. Prior to each lecture, I tagged each commit so you can easily go back to an earlier state of the repo!

The tags are as follows:

* `graphs-coloring`
* `graphs-find-paths`
* `graphs-intro`
* `graphs-make-undirected`
* `graphs-paths`
* `lists-append`
* `lists-big-3`
* `lists-duplicate`
* `lists-get-kth`
* `lists-insert-sort`
* `lists-length`
* `lists-merge-sort`
* `lists-prep`
* `lists-quick-sort`
* `lists-random-sample`
* `lists-remove-kth`
* `lists-reverse`
* `lists-rle`
* `lists-rotate`
* `misc-eval`
* `misc-n-queens`
* `misc-sierpinski`
* `numbers-approximate-pi`
* `numbers-decompose`
* `numbers-enhancing`
* `numbers-primes`
* `numbers-recurring-decimals`
* `start`
* `strings-anagram-checks`
* `strings-count-chars`
* `strings-generate-parentheses`
* `strings-justify`
* `strings-valid-parentheses`
* `trees-collect-nodes-at-level`
* `trees-intro`
* `trees-leaves`
* `trees-mirror`
* `trees-same-shape`
* `trees-size`

When you watch a lecture, you can `git checkout` the appropriate tag and the repo will go back to the exact code I had when I started the lecture.
